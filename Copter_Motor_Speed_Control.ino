/*
EEE310 : Control Systems 1: Copter Motor Project.

This is a Control Systems 1 project which will emulate an Aeropendulum.
The following components are used:
1. A2212 Copter Motor, and propellers.
2. JYQD V8.3 Brushless motor driver.
3. 10k potentiometer.
4. Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller board.
5. A 16*2 LCD to display progress(duty cycle, and angle subtended by the arm) of the system.

We use the potentiometer for reading the angle, whereas the microcontroller 
will be used to write voltages in PWM form to the motor driver for speed control.
